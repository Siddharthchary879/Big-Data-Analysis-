##Analyze the airline delay dataset using tools like PySpark or Dask to demonstrate scalability. This can involve finding trends and averages, such as the top airlines with the highest average arrival delays.

Tools/Platforms:
Tools: PySpark for big data processing.
Platform: Google Colab (free cloud-based environment) or local PySpark setup.
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Load the Dataset:
Use PySpark to load the airline delay dataset (airline_delay.csv) into a DataFrame.
Perform Analysis:
Group the data by airlines and calculate the average arrival delay (ArrDelay).
Sort the results to identify airlines with the highest average delays.
Save Results:
Save the output 

Output:
A CSV file (avg_arrival_delay_by_airline.csv) containing the top 10 airlines with the highest average arrival delays.
Example Output Table:
Airline	Avg Arrival Delay (min)
AA	15.2
DL	12.8
UA	10.5
